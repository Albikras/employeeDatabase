## Description

- Motivation: My motivation for this porject was to really test my knowleadge with mysql and how see how it can be used in a somewhat real world example
- Goal: I built this project for possible employers or companies to have an easy way to access there employee database
- Problems Solved: The problem it solves is having a clean neat way that is saved for all your employee's data
- What I Learned: There are many things i learned, the full utilization of async functions and await, how choice within inquirer can be really annoying when relating to a db.query value, I somewhat understand how to join tables through the help of my piers and my tutor, and the most important thing i learned is how annoying this challenege truly was
